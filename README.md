<h1>survey form</h1> 
<hr/>
<p>This is a very simple survey form. This templet is made with raw HTML & CSS. I made it just for my <b>practice purpose</b>. You will find some input field where you can write your name,address,email etc. There is a radio button to choose gender. There is also a checkbox and text-box. After desiging this templete you will get a clear idea of how to work with HTML form </p>


<i>HTML code --> index.html</i> <br/>
<i>CSS code --> css/style.css</i><br/>
